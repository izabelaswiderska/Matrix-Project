# Matrix-Project
The goal of this project was to design template matrix class that performs operations on matrices.

The application performs matrix operations such as:

◽ creating matrices with given dimensions

◽ reading matrix from a file

◽ matrix addition and subtraction

◽ matrix multiplication by number

◽ matrix transposition

◽ scalar product of matrix

◽ assigning and reading the values of the indicated matrix elements

◽ matrix multiplication (including vector and matrix multiplication)

◽ assigning a square matrix to values corresponding to the identity matrix 

◽ creating vectors by selecting the indicated row or column of the matrix

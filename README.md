# Matrix-Project
The goal of this project was to design template matrix class that performs operations on matrices.

The application performs matrix operations such as:
◽ creating matrices with given dimensions
◽ assigning and reading the values of the indicated matrix elements
◽ reading matrix from a file
◽ matrix addition and subtraction
◽ matrix multiplication (including vector and matrix multiplication)
◽ matrix multiplication by number
◽ matrix transposition
◽ scalar product of matrix
◽ assigning a square matrix to values corresponding to the identity matrix 
◽ creating vectors by selecting the indicated row or column of the matrix
